* Finding split paired-end reads with =ss.py=

=ss.py= first gathers all paired-end reads in the dataset in a hash by
reference name. The reads must be mapped and paired, according to the
SAM file bitflag field. Note that when only proper-paired-end reads
are used, the number of split paired-end reads produced is 0.
